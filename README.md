# CanIEatThis
CanIEatThis was an Android app created as a final year project at university. It allows the user to scan a barcode, fetch the ingredients and tells the user whether the product is suitable for Vegetarians (will be expanded to encompass Vegans, gluten-free etc).

It is now an Android, iOS and web project containing the features above as well as collecting restaurant data about dietary suitability.

## Development

Branches "android" and "ios" are "master" branches for respective platforms. Develop by branching off these branches for features/bugs/etc.

"android" and "ios" should *always* be 100% buildable and deployable to a real device.

e.g. 
android -> feature x
ios -> bug y
